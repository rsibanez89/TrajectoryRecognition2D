# Trajectory Recognition2D
This is a Windows Form Application project made in Visual Studio 2010 + C#.
The application implements the $1 algorithm to recognize 2D trajectories.
To use the application you have to draw on the "Original" panel, label the trajectory, and add it as a new training sample.
You can add different types of trajectories, and all the trajectories you want of the same type.
